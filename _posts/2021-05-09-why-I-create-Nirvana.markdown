## Why create Nirvana this project
I love develop OS and I want to be a OS developer. But from now on I only developed some BSP in Linux and used some simple feature of kernel.  
This year I want change my job to bigger company and be a OS developer. But from the interview I realize that I'm a rookie in OS, so many knowledge about OS I just read from book but never used it. I can't answer many difficulty questions in OS.  
This make me embarrassed that I already worked for 8 years but still don't know the things I have been used everyday.  
I realize that not only OS, so many tools that I used everyday I never digger those implementation. And even sometimes I read those code, I must forget it after 2 or 3 months.  
So I create this project, and my slogan is "build everything from scratch!". This attitude may not good in working, but I think it every useful in studying. After I build everything I interested and build it like other's did, I think I can got the those essentials.
## Why use github.io
Because I think the only reader it's me and I want those blogs manage with code.
## Why use English
As I just said, the only reader it's me, and those blogs just record this project growing step. So why not studying coding skills and  English together. I know my English is not good as native, and it may have some syntax error or confusion. But anyway the only reader is me.  
If you who is reading is not me and want me write some blog in Chinese, please let email me. I'll so glad that someone read my blog.  
## Roadmap
Please refer to the [projects](https://github.com/orgs/Nirvana-ckt/projects) in github.
## Difference with Readme and Wiki
I'd like use Readme to make some simple introductions, and use Wiki to describe some technical detail. github.io I will use it to record the process of problem sloving and fixing.
